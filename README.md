## Before the clinic 

1. **Sign up for an account (see below)**: We'll do all of our
   computational work on the [CSDMS JupyterHub](https://csdms.rc.colorado.edu).
   This means that we won't have to spend time installing software
   during the clinic.
1. **Review the basics of working with Python and Jupyter Notebook**:
   There are many online resources. Coding experience is not a
   prerequisite for this clinic and we will explain core concepts as
   we go along.
1. **Background reading**: Read the
   [Hobley et al., 2017](https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/5/21/2017/esurf-5-21-2017.html)
   open source paper about Landlab
